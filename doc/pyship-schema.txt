Cron Objects:

    Our cronjobs are calculated to run similar to the "at" command, specified
    when to wakeup and run to be friendly to app hosting (Heroku)
    A master scheduling process looks at the queue to add jobs
    Sample entry:
    {
        "minute":"0",
        "hour":"0",
        "mday":"*",
        "month:"*",
        "creditial_id": "cypher386",
        "job_id": 123
    }

Query Objects:
    So these will be json formatted requests:
        Query Source:  (github/confluence/jira/etc)
        Query Destination:
        Query json represntation
        Query template name (filename)
        Translated Query (actual REST URL if possible)
    Sample:
    {
        "name":"JiraIssue",
        "source":"https://jira.hyperledger.org/rest/api/2/issue/CAC-1",
        "destination":"none",
        "repr":
            {
                "proto":"https",
                "host":"jira.hyperledger.org",
                "api_prefix":"/rest/api/2",
                "api_command":"issue",
                "apt_mode":"GET",
                "target_obj":"CAC-1",
